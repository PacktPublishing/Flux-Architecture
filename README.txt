Getting Started
===============

The first thing we'll need to do, before running
any of the code examples, is to install the dependencies.
This can be done as follows:

  cd path/to/code
  npm install

This will install all the NPM package dependencies used
by the various code examples. Next, you should make sure
that webpack is installed as a Global package:

  npm install -g webpack

Now you're ready to run the examples.

Running Examples
================

First, you need to change into the directory of the
example that you want to run:

  cd path/to/example

Then you can build the example by running:

  webpack

And if you want to make changes to the code and
have the example built automatically, you can run:

  webpack --watch
